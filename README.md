Recognising handwritten math notations in equations from inkml files
hack_data_train_train_0.inkml is a sample input file. The test data files did not have the truth labels.
I have included the utility scripts to process, read, and split the inkml file into different mathematical notations 
and group them into folders by notation so they can be used to train a simple CNN model to do handwritten mathematical 
notation recognition
